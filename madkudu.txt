How Marketing Uses MadKudu

The Marketer’s Dilemma
The Madkudu Way
Why is this relevant?
This article is intended to be used by the marketer who wants to see the quality of their inbound leads by channel and by campaign.  (Report implementation instructions are available to download, see link at bottom of this article).

The Marketer’s Dilemma

Potentially Burning Marketing Budget

“I spend on an acquisition channel, but it takes the length of the sales cycle to see if the channel is valuable enough to keep investing in.”

Screen_Shot_2020-05-19_at_11.54.42_AM.png

The Madkudu Way

Smart Insights, Less Waiting, Accurate Decisions

“Accurately assess the performance of acquisition channels quickly”

mceclip0.png

Why is this relevant?

Use your MadKudu Customer Fit score to assess the quality of leads per channel and adjust spend accordingly

Your Madkudu customer fit score is an indicator of your expected pipeline. Use it to determine the quality per channel and optimize your marketing spend per channel.

Generating high quality leads that aren’t converting?  Use this as an input to nurture your campaigns and walk those valuable leads further down the funnel.

Bet big on the channels that drive quality leads, stop wasting money on channels that don’t.

 Screen_Shot_2020-04-28_at_2.07.10_PM.png

Assessing Response Quality By Channel

Discriminate between channels generating mostly low (Free Rates) vs mostly high (Whitepaper) quality leads.

Screen_Shot_2020-03-23_at_3.25.07_PM.png

Compare volumes and cost of acquisition to determine whether it makes sense to move your marketing budget from one channel to another. If the cost of acquisition for a quality lead from Free Rates happens to be 10X less that the cost of acquisition for Whitepaper - then it would make sense to generate those Free Rate quality leads, and nurture them.

Response Quality By Channel Over Time

As Marketers, we want to understand if the quality of leads per channel evolves over time.  In this example, we see that the volume of quality leads maintains, and even increases slightly.

Screen_Shot_2020-03-23_at_3.27.54_PM.pngTherefore we would expect to see performance increase marginally (increase of leads to closed won by this channel).  If we allocate additional budget spend to this channel, we would also want to see an increase in the lead to deal ratio. 

In this next example, we see that the volume of quality leads drastically decreases.

Screen_Shot_2020-03-23_at_3.30.16_PM.png

However, the revenue generated by the channel may still remain consistent, if the number of quality leads is maintained.  If we spend more on this channel, and there is no increase in quality leads which convert to deals, we will reduce the ROI for this channel, despite the revenue remaining the same.

Score Lookup

Benefits of Score Lookup
How to use the Score lookup? 
FAQ
Why does the score here differ from the score I see in my CRM?
The Score Lookup tool is your secret weapon to easily answer the "Why was this lead scored this way?" 

Benefits of Score Lookup

Improved transparency: with the Score Lookup, you have full visibility into how the Customer Fit score is calculated for any given lead and the factors that contribute to them. This allows you to identify any gaps or changes to make in your model or data sources. No blackbox! 

Build trust with your Sales team: by providing Sales or Marketing with clear and concise explanations for scores, you'll be able to create trust in your scoring.

How to use the Score lookup? 

Log into your MadKudu account app.madkudu.com
Click on Score Lookup on the left navigation bar
Enter any email in the search bar and click  View score
GIF_score_lookup.gif

You'll then see the following sections:

Score result: view the score and the signals returned by any of your Customer Fit models deployed 


Score explanation: identify why a lead is scored this way, so you can provide Sales teams with clear and concise explanations for why certain leads are prioritized or not. 

Score breakdown: the Score Lookup provides a clear breakdown of the score calculation steps, so you can see exactly how each lead is scored, based on your historical data and your business override rules. 
Enrichment: view which enrichment data points are used to score a lead, and where they come from, whether it's from MadKudu's enrichment partners or your CRM. This provides an added layer of transparency and allows you to verify the reliability of your data sources.

FAQ

Why does the score here differ from the score I see in my CRM?

This is because the profiles page displays the customer fit score and signals returned by MadKudu API, which is the same as the realtime scoring in your integration. If you have a batch model for your Customer Fit model, this means you are probably using enrichment from your CRM which can only be leveraged in batch scoring. To read more about batch and realtime scoring, see more here.

Step 1: Send Common Room data to MadKudu
Option 1: via S3 
Option 2: via Snowflake or BigQuery
Step 2: Map Common Room data in MadKudu
Step 3: Create playbooks for your reps
Common Room is a great tool to track your prospects' interactions with your community assets (Slack, Discourse,...), social media (LinkedIn, Youtube, X ....) or open-source products (Github..). You can include this in your MadKudu scoring and in MadKudu Copilot for your reps. For example,  creating playbooks for your reps to reach out to new LinkedIn followers, github comments...etc. Here's how to!

Pre-requisites

You have a Common Room account and implemented it
You have requested Common Room to share your data in a S3 bucket
or You are sending Common Room data to your Snowflake or BigQuery instance
Step 1: Send Common Room data to MadKudu

Option 1: via S3 

Grant MadKudu access to the S3 bucket with an IAM role

Use MadKudu's instructions here to grant MadKudu access to your S3 bucket via an IAM role 

Once set up, MadKudu will start pulling data from your S3 bucket 

Option 2: via Snowflake or BigQuery

In MadKudu Copilot (embedded in your Salesforce or the Chrome extension), 

In the left nav bar click on +New playbook
Use the AI prompt to generate playbook with "Qualified people who join slack community", or configure manually with the following filters: 
person activity event is New Slack User AND person customer fit is one of very good, good
